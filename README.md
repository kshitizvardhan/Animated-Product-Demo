# Animated Product Demo

Welcome to the Animated Product Demo project! This repository showcases an interactive website featuring amazing animations with a 3D model of the iPhone 15 Pro. Through this project, I have learned and implemented several key technologies:

- Mastered GSAP for creating intricate animations.
- Learned how to make precise tweaks and manage timelines with GSAP.
- Gained proficiency in Three.js for rendering 3D graphics.
