# Animated Product Demo

Welcome to the Animated Product Demo project! This repository showcases an interactive website featuring amazing animations with a 3D model of the iPhone 15 Pro. Through this project, I have learned and implemented several key technologies:

- Mastered GSAP for creating intricate animations.
- Learned how to make precise tweaks and manage timelines with GSAP.
- Gained proficiency in Three.js for rendering 3D graphics.

## Key Concepts Learned

### GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)

- **Animation**: Creating complex and smooth animations for various elements.
- **Tweaks and Timelines**: Fine-tuning animations and managing sequences using timelines.
- **Interactive Controls**: Implementing user interactions to control animations dynamically.

## Thank You

Thank you for exploring the Animated Product Demo project! This project has provided me with valuable insights into combining 3D graphics with advanced animation techniques, preparing me to create dynamic and interactive web applications.
